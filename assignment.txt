About the name variable.
The" __name__"is a special Python variable that represents the name of the current module
When the Python interpreter runs a script, it sets the __name__ variable for that script. 
If the script is the main program being run, then __name__ is set to "__main__
If the script is being imported into another module, then __name__ is set to the name of the module.
